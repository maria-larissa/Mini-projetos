# My first C mini projects

This repository has some more elaborate and advanced code from some mini-projects I did in the Computational Mathematics course.

### 1st mini-project

The 1st mini project has the objective of generating a report about the actions performed by a university/company during one year in 3 cities. The data is collected and stored during the above mentioned period, the data consists of which city the action took place, the code of the action and the amount of people benefited by the action.

Databases:

 1) Appointments: containing information about the appointments made in a doctor's office/hospital/pet shop, such as appointment code, medication code and amount of medication; and
 2) Medications: containing information about the medications used by the office/hospital/pet shop, such as the medication code and unit price. The data is collected and stored during the above mentioned period, the data consists of CPF and the amount of each purchase made by the customer at the store.

The 4th mini project has the objective of registering people's information. After analyzing the information, it returns the amount of people who took the 1st dose, but did not take the 2nd, the average of people who have not taken any dose. In addition, it returns the code vector of the people who took the 1st dose.

People's information:

 1) COVID-19 vaccination cycle: in the vaccination cycle only 1st and 2nd dose are considered.
 2) identification code;
 3) age;
